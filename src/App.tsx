          Leading a team is about carefully listen to the team members, putting the trust to them, their skills, their knowledge and give them space to contribute. Then you point a direction.

          <span className="category-title">Description:</span>
          I wanted to build a game to inspire my kids to start coding and during a hackday I did
          the classical game asteroids. The game is based on the <K>canvas</K> element
          with frame based animation. I used <K>React</K> to structure the app and
          added <K>Redux</K> to provide data across the application. The sounds are recorded by me.
          <br/>
          Later on I <K>dockerized</K> the app and let the it be served via <K>http2</K> protocol.
          Then the bundling became more unnecessary and i therefore converted the app to be based on <K>snowpack</K>.

          I volunteered to work as a Frontend Developer for the start up of the Welcome App.
          The work includes Frontend development with framework such <K>Ionic</K> and <K>AngularJs</K> framework.
          <br/><br/>
          Welcome! is an app with the purpose to make it easier for newly arrived refugees and locals to connect.
          The app contains a private chats and events advertising. Messages and dynamic content were being auto-translated
