        From the beginning, self-learned. I started my proffessional web engineer career <K>1999</K> and have since then,
        worked in many different kind of sets. I have run my own business, worked in many different kind of teams, different kind of companies, both small and big.
        I have had different roles. I have been a <K>Web Engineer</K>, <K>Engineering Manager</K> and today i work as a <K>Web Architect Engineer</K> at one one of the biggest websites in Sweden.
        <br/>
        I have many times contributed to <K>open source</K> projects. I have seen new technologies raise, but I have also seen many fall. I have seen new fancy frameworks being replaced by another. But one thing that has been persistent during these years, is my passion for the web.

          Leading a team is about carefully listen to the team members, putting the trust to them, their skills, their knowledge and give them space to contribute. Then you point a direction.

      What i think is absolutely most important when practice SCRUM is to work very <K>close to the production</K> environment. If you are comfortable and do truly know how
      the production environment works and how it is set up, you will be able to solve problems faster, see the solution faster, be more confidence to take quicker decisions, take more correct decisions etc. All that comes together with the result of a lower <K>Time To Market (TTM)</K> .

          <span className="category-title">Description:</span>
          I wanted to build a game to inspire my kids to start coding and during a hackday I did
          the classical game asteroids. The game is based on the <K>canvas</K> element
          with frame based animation. I used <K>React</K> to structure the app and
          added <K>Redux</K> to provide data across the application. The sounds are recorded by me.
          <br/>
          Later on I <K>dockerized</K> the app and let the it be served via <K>http2</K> protocol.
          Then the bundling became more unnecessary and i therefore converted the app to be based on <K>snowpack</K>.
